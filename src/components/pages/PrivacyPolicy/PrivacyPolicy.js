                        This Privacy Policy describes the types of Personal Information we collect from visitors of our
                        public Websites and our practices for using, maintaining, sharing, and protecting it. It also
                        describes the rights and choices you may have with respect to your Personal Information and
                        how you may contact us. <br /><br /><br />

                        When using our Websites, you may choose to interact with features from third parties that
                        operate independently from BeHealthian, such as social media widgets and links to third-party
                        websites. BeHealthian has no control over and is not responsible for the privacy practices of such
                        third parties. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the extent BeHealthian does not own or control
                        any linked websites or features you visit or use. We recommend that you familiarize yourself with
                        the privacy practices of those third parties.
